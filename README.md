Here, there are four assignments of data science course at McMaster university.
Instructor: Dr. Pratheepa Jeganathan


# Assignmnet 1: Data visualization
In this assignment we uses R packages for visualization.
Also I used three difference Dataset that I explained in RMA file. This was a sample of how to load data set,tidy it and visualize the important trends or points.

# Assignment 2: Classification
In this assignment we used `logistic regression` and `K-nearest neighbour` methods for classification. We will use a Car insurance claim [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/racholsan/customer-data) in 2021 that has collected based on customers of that insurance company.

# Assignment 3: Clustering
In assignment3 we used the same dataset of assignment2, the methods here are `k-means clustering`, `hierarchical clustering` and `Gaussian mixture model`.

# Assignment 4: Spars models
In assignment4 we used `Ridge Regression`, `LASSO` and  `Partial Least Square PLS` for a dataset with huge features.
